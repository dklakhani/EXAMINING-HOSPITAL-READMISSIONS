# EXAMINING-HOSPITAL-READMISSIONS
My project aims to create two classification models: 1. Predicting if a patient will be readmitted within 30 days, aiding timely interventions. 2. Multiclass classification predicting readmission timeframe ("No", "&lt;30 days", ">30 days") for tailored post-discharge care.
